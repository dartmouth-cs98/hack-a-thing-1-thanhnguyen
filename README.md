# FirstReactNativeProject

## Description

This is an Expo project meant to explore development of a mobile app using React Native, Redux, and other technologies.
I started to make a todo list mobile application.

## Learnings

- How to setup a Expo project and run it on phone
  - Selected the minimal typescript expo template
- How to set up a React Native Redux project
- How to set up eslint for typescript and typescript react
- How to use Redux toolkit with typescript to prevent type errors
- Explored React Naviation
- Explored React Native Paper

## What didn't work

- I had a hard time figuring out how to run the app on my phone. I kept getting expo problems, but I eventually just scrapped the original project and re-initialized the expo project and transfered my code which worked.

## Credits

- This base code for this project is the boilerplate code created when starting a new Expo Project. See this page (<https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup>) for how to quickstart the expo project.
- I did this project individually.
